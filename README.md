# Welcome to Django! GhostPost
Harness the power of django and the inter to Boast or Roast anyone or anything with complete anonymity. Did you love that chick-flick but afraid your bros would grill you for it? Do you secretly hate guac and fear being banished to the guacless northern nation beyond the Niagra? Did someone surprise you with an act of kindness or you witness someone trash talking the glorious CyberTruck and  you wish repentance on them? Now you can let people know. It's kind of like reddit but for annonymous gossiping!
